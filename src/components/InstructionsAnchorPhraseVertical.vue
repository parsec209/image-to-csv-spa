      The <strong>vertical search method</strong> first looks for an <i>anchor phrase</i> of your choosing within the document, and once found, 
      starts counting the <i>string retrieval types</i> located directly beneath the anchor phrase, line by line,  
      until either the max <i>string count</i> is met or the bottom of the page is reached.
    </p>
    <InstructionsAnchorPhrase />
    <p>The <strong>string retrieval type</strong> can be either a <i>word</i> or a <i>phrase</i>, and the <i>phrase</i> option is selected by default. 
    <p>
      A <strong>word</strong>, in the context of <i>string retrieval types</i>, is a group of one or more characters 
      (including special chars) on a single line, with no spaces in between them. A word terminates at a space.  
    </p>
    <p>
      A <strong>phrase</strong>, in the context of <i>string retrieval types</i>, is a group of one or more <i>words</i> on a single line, with no more than one space
      in between them, and terminates when it meets two or more spaces. 
    </p>
    <p>
      The <strong>string count</strong> is the number of <i>string retrieval types</i> to be counted directly beneath the <i>anchor phrase</i>, with a single count 
      being selected by default. <i>Directly beneath</i>, in this context, means that the <i>string retrieval type</i> horizontally overlaps with the 
      <i>anchor phrase</i>. Secondly, only the first horizontally overlapping <i>string retrieval type</i> found in a line will be 
      added to the count, and any remaining <i>string retrieval types</i> in that same line will be disregarded. The count then continues to the next line down and 
      repeats the process until the last <i>string retrieval type</i> in the count is reached, which will be used as the cell section value. An empty cell section
      value will be returned if the <i>anchor phrase</i> is invalid, not found, or if the <i>string count</i> exceeds the remaining <i>string retrieval types</i> that
      are directly beneath the <i>anchor phrase</i>.

    <p><strong>Examples:</strong></p>
    <li>Anchor phrases are highlighted in yellow</li>
    <li>Counted string retrieval types are highlighted in orange</li>
    <li>Last string retrieval type of the count is highlighted in green, and used as the cell section value</li>

    <p><strong>Scenario 5:</strong> Limitation with PDF files (does not apply to GIF or TIFF files) </p>
    <p>
      If the characters entered into the search string field are found to be part of a larger word within the document text,
      the application will use the complete word as the anchor phrase. 
      So, looking back at example 4, if you were to enter that word segment as the anchor phrase, and the text currently being parsed came
      from a PDF file, the application will use the yellow-highlighted encapsulating word shown below as its anchor phrase. Note that 
      PDFs do not have this limitation when using the horizontal search method.
