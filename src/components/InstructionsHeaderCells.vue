    <strong>Header cell values</strong> are used as the column names in the top row of a CSV file. Every recurring document must include a header, 
    and that header's values will be used in every CSV file that is generated from that recurring document's extraction rules. In order to associate a header with a 
    recurring doc, you have two options: 1) save a header by itself on the <b-link to="/index/header">My headers</b-link> page and reuse it later when setting up a 
    recurring document (useful if you plan to reuse the same header in multiple recurring docs), or 2) you can just enter header cell values directly into the table on 
    a recurring document setup page.

    There can be no empty header cell values, nor duplicate header cell values, within a table. The row length can range from one to 52 cells, and can be adjusted with the 
    <i>Add Column</i> and <i>Delete Column</i> buttons.
