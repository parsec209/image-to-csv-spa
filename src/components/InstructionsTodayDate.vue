  <p>
    The <strong>today's date</strong> option uses the current day's date from your browser as the cell section value, formatted by default as YYYY/MM/DD (you can always 
    change the format, see help section for <i>Date formatting</i>). The application will not scan the document text for anything. The <i>search string</i> field is 
    disabled when this option is selected.
