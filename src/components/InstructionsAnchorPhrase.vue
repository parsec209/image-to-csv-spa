    An <strong>anchor phrase</strong> is a document text string that is expected to always exist in the same position relative to the text value you are seeking.
    Any string of characters you see in a document can be used as an <i>anchor phrase</i>, as long as those characters are all on the same line and they have no more
    than one space in between each other. Two or more spaces, or a line break, terminates the phrase. The anchor phrase is typed into the 
    <strong>search string</strong> form field.
