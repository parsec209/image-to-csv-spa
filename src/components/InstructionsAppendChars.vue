    You can enter any characters of your choosing, including spaces, into the <strong>append characters</strong> field, and these characters will be added 
    to the end of the cell section value when the CSV file is generated. Beneath the field, you can see a preview of the appended characters between a set of 
    double quotes. This is especially useful if you need something specific in between two cell section values, like a space or hyphen.
