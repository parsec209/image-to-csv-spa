      The <strong>ID phrase</strong> is a unique piece of text that the application looks for within a document immediately after the document is uploaded. 
      This is how the upload is identified as one of your saved recurring documents. From there, it will then know which recurring doc rules to follow 
      for the rest of the CSV generation process. Therefore, it is important that an ID phrase be unique enough so that there will be no ambiguity on which recurring doc 
      an upload belongs to (i.e. using a common phrase like "Invoice #" is not recommended). Including at least one ID phrase is required, but you can optionally include 
      a second ID phrase to narrow down the doc identification process even further. Note that if you do include this second phrase, the application must find BOTH 
      phrases within the extracted document text in order for the upload to be identified as a recurring doc.

      The ID phrase you use must be a piece of text in the document consisting of one or more characters (letters, numbers, symbols) no more than one space apart from 
      each other, and must all be on the same horizontal line. A phrase ends the moment it is followed by two or more spaces, or a line/page break. Using an invalid
      or nonexistant phrase will result in the application skipping any further processing of that upload. 
      <i>Note that occasionally the application may not agree with you on what counts as a single space in an image file; however, the vast majority of the time, it will.
      If it looks like a phrase, per the rules just mentioned, the application will almost always detect it as a phrase.</i> And make sure to type the phrase into the 
      form exactly as it appears in the document! (i.e. single spaces in between words, when they exist). The phrase can come from any page of the document you decide to 
      scan, and it can even be a subset of a larger phrase (i.e. if you see the text "Good afternoon!" in the document, it is fine to use "ood afternoo" as your ID 
      phrase, as long as it follows the aforementioned phrase rules).
