    The <strong>custom value</strong> option will use whatever value you input into the <i>search string</i> field as the cell 
    section value. You can even enter Excel formulas here, which will evaluate when the CSV file is opened in Excel. 
    This is particularly useful when cells need to reference each other, or if their values are conditional upon other cell values.
